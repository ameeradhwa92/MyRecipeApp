Hands-On Test – Create a Recipe App

Create a Recipe App with the following criteria: -
•	Use Kotlin as the programming language
•	Use at least one type of storage method/libraries available in Android 
•	Given an xml file with recipe types data (recipetypes.xml), use that to populate the recipe types into a Spinner/Picker control. 
•	Pre-populate your own sample recipes data complying with recipetypes.xml
•	Create a page to list recipes (filterable by recipe types)
•	Ability to create new recipe based on available recipe type with picture, ingredients and steps
•	Create a detailed recipe pages that display the recipe’s image along with the ingredients and steps with update and delete feature, all displaying items should be editable
•	Upload the project into any public Git hosting services and ensure that your project is buildable

Your App should:
•	Adhere to Google’s Material Design principles for UI design
•	Display recipe data in a properly formatted way
•	Persist recipe data across app restart
•	Able to perform normal operation without crashing
•	Fit into any screen size and orientation

Your App should not:
•	Failed to build the project
•	Crash in any of the operations performed in app
•	Have alignment problem that cover/overlap other view in smaller devices

Please demonstrate the following:
•	Adherence to Object Oriented Programming principles, and good programming practices
•	Adherence to Java/Kotlin programming naming and format convention.
* You are given 3 hours to build the app. Zip the Android project files and send back to me via email along with the project hosting URL.

Bonus points if you can complete the additional requirements below:
•	Reactive Programming: Exhibit Reactive Programming with RxJava or Kotlin coroutine. Show how you properly achieve component/value binding.
•	Architecture pattern: To build a clean and easy maintain code, by applying one of the architecture pattern like MVVM. Additional time given: 1.5 hour.
•	Authentication: Login and Logout feature with authentication, encryption and session persistency until logout. Additional time given: 1 hour.
•	Networking: Adding API layer to fetch data from online or self-hosted source. Examples of implementation are authentication, self-hosted recipe type, etc. Additional time given: 1 hour.
•	Dependency Injection: Implement dependency injection to modularity. Please show that you are able to achieve reusability, maintainability and scalability using dependencies architecture. Additional time given: 1.5 hour.
•	Unit Test: Adding unit test and UI test to detect changes that can break the code design and reduce defects. Additional time given: 1.5 hours
